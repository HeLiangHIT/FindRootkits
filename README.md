# FindRootkits

Current tasks for april-may( maybe final) :
1) find rootkit files ~ 20-30 and use it with sqlite, which from they can be got in md5 and then compared with system file's md5 
2) find info about ip and searching for processes and files running on ips -> how to get file's included in current processes 
3) make white list ( it helps to avoid false detection e.g script always contains libreoffice file in it's results)
4) improve annotation - learn some works on cyberlibrica or smth with very similar name for this
less phrases in xakerist.ru and habrahabr.ru copy-past-style, more spread, underline importance of this little research
